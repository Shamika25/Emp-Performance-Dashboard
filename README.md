🧩 Business Problem-
Organizations often struggle to monitor employee performance effectively due to scattered data, lack of real-time insights, and poor visibility into individual and departmental productivity. Without a centralized system to track KPIs like performance ratings, goal achievements, learning engagement, absenteeism, and disciplinary actions, HR teams face challenges in:
-Identifying underperforming employees in time
-Recognizing top talent for rewards or promotions
-Aligning training programs with performance gaps
-Understanding department-wise productivity and risks
-Making data-driven decisions to improve retention and development
This lack of structured performance data leads to low employee engagement, reduced productivity, and inefficient HR interventions.

✅ Solution-
The Employee Performance Dashboard provides a centralized, interactive, and data-driven view of workforce performance. It enables leadership and HR to make informed decisions based on real-time metrics, helping them:
1. Recognize patterns in employee behavior and output
2. Take timely action on risks like absenteeism or disciplinary issues
3. Align performance with training needs
4. Improve overall organizational productivity and morale
